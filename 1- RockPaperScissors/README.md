A simple console-based **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in **C++** where the player competes against the computer over multiple rounds.

The project was built after completing **Algorithms Level 2**, before learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It focuses on writing clean procedural code using functions, enums, structs, and pass-by-reference.

# ✨ Features

- 🎮 Play against the computer
- 🔢 Choose the number of rounds (1–10)
- 🎲 Random computer choices
- 📊 Live score tracking
- 🏆 Automatic game winner detection
- 🎨 Console color changes depending on the round result
- 🔁 Play again without restarting the program

# 🧠 Project Structure

The project follows a modular design where each function has a single responsibility.

### Main Components

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| `ReadHowManyRounds()` | Reads and validates the number of rounds |
| `Choice_Player()` | Gets the player's choice |
| `Choice_Computer()` | Generates a random computer choice |
| `RandomNumber()` | Generates random numbers |
| `WhoWonTheRound()` | Determines the winner of a round |
| `WinnerName()` | Converts the winner enum into readable text |
| `ChoiceName()` | Converts the choice enum into readable text |
| `PrintRoundGame()` | Displays round information |
| `WhoWonTheGame()` | Determines the overall game winner |
| `FillGameResults()` | Stores the final game statistics |
| `PlayGame()` | Runs all game rounds |
| `ShowGameOverScreen()` | Displays the game over screen |
| `showFinalGame()` | Prints the final game results |
| `StartGame()` | Controls the game loop and replay option |

# 🎮 Gameplay

1. Enter the number of rounds (**1–10**).
2. Choose:

```
1 → Stone
2 → Paper
3 → Scissor
```

3. The computer randomly selects its move.
4. The winner of the round is displayed.
5. Scores are updated after every round.
6. When all rounds finish, the final winner is announced.
7. The player can choose to play again.

# 📚 What I Learned

During this project I practiced:

- Designing a complete console application
- Splitting logic into reusable functions
- Working with `enum` and `struct`
- Passing objects by reference
- Organizing procedural code
- Tracking game state across multiple rounds
- Building a project before learning OOP
